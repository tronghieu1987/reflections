1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	- The folder becomes a repository but without any commits yet (because no message yet to track).
	- Need to make the first commit 

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	- Staging area is the bridge between the working directory and the repository;
	- It allows us to add files one by one after we are certain about that specific one before making a commit to multiple files.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	- I will just add the file to the stage once a logical change is made in the working directory

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	- When I need to experiment changes to the code but not want to change the code base
	- Git branches feature just does the job
