1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  - SO that I could access the content anywhere on another computer
  - It allows me to share with others more quickly

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	- So that you could decide when to pull a meaningful commit from the remote
	- The remote is shared by public, so many changes need to be approved by you before they are pulled
