1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  - SO that I could access the content anywhere on another computer
  - It allows me to share with others more quickly

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	- So that you could decide when to pull a meaningful commit from the remote
	- The remote is shared by public, so many changes need to be approved by you before they are pulled

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	- Difference in location: Forks work between remote repositories (on GitHub); Clones work between locals and local vs online; Branches are within each repository and are the objects that you fork/pull/push
